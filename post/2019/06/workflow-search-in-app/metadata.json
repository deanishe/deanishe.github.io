Native applications automatically use the contents of this pasteboard as a search query.\n\nIf this doesn't work with an application, set `use_find_pasteboard` to \"0\" and the workflow will attempt to type the query into the application's search field instead.\n\nIf the workflow is typing the query too early, alter `delay` to change how long the workflow waits for the app's Find field to activate before it attempts to enter the query.\n\nIf `wait_visible` is \"1\", workflow waits until the application is visible before trying to start a search.\n\n`timeout` is how many seconds the workflow will wait for the application's windows to appear.",
