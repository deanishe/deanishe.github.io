This is relatively clunky and slow, but doesn't require any additional software or services.\n\nAlternatively, it can use Word's native PDF export, which is based on a Microsoft-provided online service. This, of course, has serious privacy implications.\n\nTo use the online service, set variable \"USE_ONLINE_SERVICE\" to \"true\".\n\nSet variable \"OPEN_WITH\" to the name of the application you'd like the exported PDFs to be opened in.",
